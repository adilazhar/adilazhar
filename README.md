👋 Hey there, I'm Adil Azhar! 😄

🌟 A person with a great passion for technology and sports 🏈

💻 My first programming language was Java, and oh, I loved it!

⏰ Time changes, and so does love; now, it's JavaScript ❤️

🛠 I spend most of my time building websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress

🏆 My favorite sport depends on whether I'm playing or watching:

- 🎮 If I'm playing, it's whatever sport I'm currently playing
- 📺 If I'm not, then football (soccer) tops the list ⚽

🥈 Badminton is in the 2nd tier, along with basketball 🏸🏀

🏎 And I'm fascinated by F1 – it's Formula 1, not your keyboard button, LOL 😂

👋 Take care 😉
